# VR-Tutorial
 A tutorial for interacting with virtual reality, taught through a hand panel with text and videos.

 The tutorial itself does not require any scripts or objects outside of those in the hand panel and guidance arrows, making it easy to add to another project.
 The tutorial's content can easily be modified and expanded through accessing a single script and its' assets.
